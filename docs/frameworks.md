# Frameworks

Since it operates at the network level by intercepting select async GenAI requests, `batchling` is natively compatible with all frameworks using `httpx` or `aiohttp` as their async request engine.

Below are the frameworks we tested that we are sure are compatible with `batchling`, along with examples of how to use `batchling` with them:

- [Instructor](frameworks/instructor.md)
- [LangChain](frameworks/langchain.md)
- [LiteLLM](frameworks/litellm.md)
- [Pydantic AI](frameworks/pydantic_ai.md)
- [Pydantic Evals](frameworks/pydantic_evals.md)
