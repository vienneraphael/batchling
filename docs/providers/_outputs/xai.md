grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning answer:
Claude Monet is widely regarded as the best French painter for his revolutionary Impressionist masterpieces like *Water Lilies*.

grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning answer:
**Paris** is the capital of France.

This is a well-established fact: Paris has served as the capital since the 10th century (with brief interruptions, like during the French Revolution), and it's confirmed by official sources such as the French government's website (e.g., diplomatie.gouv.fr) and international bodies like the United Nations. It's home to landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre, and France's central government is based there.
