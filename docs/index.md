Batchling is a Python library to run large-scale GenAI batch experiments across providers with a unified API. It helps with batch creation, file management, error handling, and structured outputs while keeping experiments reproducible.

## Get started

- Read the architecture overview to understand how batch requests flow through the system.
- Explore provider adapters to see how URLs are normalized and results decoded.
- Check the API surface to learn how to integrate batchify into your code.
