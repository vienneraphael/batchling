# Advanced Features

If you become a power-user of `batchling`, you might be interested in mastering/understanding more advanced features, like:

- [Cache](./cache.md): How cache is saved for incoming requests and how much time it is kept.

- [Dry Run](./dry-run.md): How to start a fake batch run to see if everything makes sense before spending the $$$.

- [Deferred Execution](./deferred-mode.md): How to gracefully exit a batch if you want to avoid a long-running polling process on your computer.
