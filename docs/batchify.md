# batchify

The `batchify` function is the one and only entrypoint for the `batchling` library, everything starts from there.

It comes with a bunch of parameters that you can customize to alter how batching is performed:

::: batchling.api.batchify
    options:
      separate_signature: true
      show_root_heading: true
      show_root_full_path: false
      show_source: true
      heading_level: 2
      docstring_style: numpy
