## Repository Expectations

- Document public utilities in `docs/` when you change behavior.
- Whenever you import typing, use: `import typing as t`
- Use python native type hinting whenever possible, e.g. `list[dict]`
- After making changes, run tests using pytest to make sure you did not break anything.
- To install libraries to the project, use `uv add`
